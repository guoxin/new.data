This package of codes generates Table 5 of the draft
"Towards a Mathematical Foundation of Immunology and Amino Acid Chains"
available at arXiv: http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.6031v2

The C dynamic library should be compiled in unix-like system
(e.g. MacOS, Linux) since POSIX thread tool is used. To compile,
just type

$ make

and the Makefile script will finish all the things.

File "new.Data" contains the new binding data selected as
described in the paper for Table 5.

The file "internals.R" stores some necessary functions used.
The program "fixLambda.R" was used to fix by leave one out cross 
validation the regularization parameter lambda. It verifies that
exp(-13) is just the optimal value. If you believe what I say,
you need not to run it.

The main program is in the R file "gen.tab5.R" which will output
an R data package "report.Rdata" from where the predicted
binding affinity can be found. These values are used to generate
the Table 5 mentioned above. To run it, try

$ Rscipt gen.tab5.R

I also made some codes to cope with Nielsen's software
http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/cgi-bin/nph-sw_request?netMHCIIpan
For using the software, I suppose one adjust the data 
himself/herself. However if you feel it too difficult,
the package "compare with MHCIIpan2.0.zip" maybe a fine resort. Many files 
are stored there and I just forgot how they were operated. If you have to
turn to the package, good luck.
